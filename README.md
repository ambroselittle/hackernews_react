Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Check that out for more info on the basic structure. The app follows the tutorial outlined in [The Road to Learn React](https://www.educative.io/collection/5740745361195008/5676830073815040). So you can blame the author there for any craziness. :)
